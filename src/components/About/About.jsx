                    <p>When I was 15
                    years old I worked in my uncle’s computer
                    repair shop. Since then I discovered the
                    wonders of computers. Most of my time I
                    performed hardware operations during my
                    work and created positive customer service
                    experience. During my associate degree I
                    took a few classes in coding because I
                    was always limited by my knowledge of
                    coding. After learning the basic concepts
                    of coding I fell in love. It’s something
                    that I can enjoy. I completed some
                    courses on youtube but it wasn’t enough for me. I started researching schools where I could go to learn coding. I discovered the General Assembly school and it was honestly the best decision in my life.
